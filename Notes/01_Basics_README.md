# 📘 01_Basics - Python Fundamentals

This folder lays the groundwork for your Python journey. It focuses on understanding the basic syntax and data operations that form the foundation of all Python programs.

## ✅ Topics Covered

### 1. Variables
- Used to store information.
- No need to declare the type explicitly.
```python
x = 5
name = "Waseem"
````

### 2. Data Types

* `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`
* Use `type()` to check the type.

### 3. Input and Output

* `input()` is used to take input from the user.
* `print()` displays output.

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello", name)
```

### 4. Type Casting

* Convert one type to another using `int()`, `float()`, `str()`.

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
```

### 5. Arithmetic and Logical Operators

* Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`
* Logical: `and`, `or`, `not`

### 6. String Manipulation

* Strings are immutable sequences.
* Common methods: `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.strip()`, `.replace()`, `.split()`
* String formatting:

```python
name = "Waseem"
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Understanding the basics is essential for building anything in Python — from scripts and automation to web apps and machine learning models. These fundamentals are the stepping stones for everything that follows.

## 🚀 Learning Outcome

By completing this section, you should be able to:

* Write simple programs
* Interact with users
* Perform basic data manipulation

Keep this folder as a reference throughout your journey — many errors in advanced topics trace back to basics.
