# 🐍 Python Journey for Machine Learning 🚀

This repository is my structured journey of learning **Python programming** with a clear goal:  
> To build a strong foundation for becoming a **Machine Learning Engineer**.

Each folder represents a key stage in my progress, from mastering the basics to preparing for real-world ML projects.
