# 🧠 Projects

This folder contains beginner and mid-level Python projects built during my **Python Journey**. Each project was designed to practice specific programming concepts — starting from simple control flow to handling data structures and modular thinking.

These projects represent **milestones in my learning**. They are console-based, intentionally lightweight, but each one helped me practice problem solving and gradually move towards real-world applications.

## 📁 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Login System

A simple **username & password login system** that was my first attempt at handling user authentication logic. It focuses on basic condition checks, loops, and handling user input.

#### 🔧 Features:

* Validate username and password
* Allow limited login attempts
* Prevent unauthorized access
* Future upgrades planned: password masking, "forgot password" option, file-based storage

#### 🧠 Concepts Used:

* Control Flow (`if-else`)
* Loops
* User Input

### 2️⃣ Weekly Health Tracker

This project acts as a **basic health monitoring tool**. The user can input daily water intake, steps, or other health stats for 7 days. At the end, it calculates the **total and average**, helping to visualize weekly progress.

#### 🔧 Features:

* Input daily health stats for a week
* Automatically calculate total and average values
* Handles invalid input
* Easy to expand with new metrics in future

#### 🧠 Concepts Used:

* `for` loop for weekly data collection
* List accumulation and iteration
* Input validation

### 3️⃣ Student Gradebook System

The **Gradebook System** was my first attempt at handling student marks and grades in a structured way. It calculates grades, validates input, and provides summary statistics like **highest, lowest, and average marks**. The system also exports data to a text file.

#### 🔧 Features:

* Input number of students and their marks
* Calculate letter grades (A+, A, A-, etc.)
* Handles invalid or out-of-range inputs
* Display average, highest, and lowest marks
* Export report to `student_grades.txt`

#### 🧠 Concepts Used:

* Control Flow (`if-elif-else`)
* Functions for modular logic
* Loops for iteration
* File handling

### 4️⃣ Student Record System (Mid Level)

This was my **most advanced project so far** in the control flow/data structure phase. Unlike the Gradebook System, this project introduced a more **modular, step-by-step approach**, handling multiple students with **unique IDs** and generating detailed **report cards**.

It was built with guidance, but I contributed actively to the first steps and logic. This project was a **big leap** towards thinking like a problem solver and writing cleaner, more structured code.

#### 🔧 Features:

* Register multiple students with **unique IDs**
* Input subject-wise marks
* Automatically calculate average marks and assign grades
* Generate and display **individual report cards**
* Modular approach with reusable functions

#### 🧠 Concepts Used:

* Control Flow (`if, elif, else`, `break/continue`)
* Data Structures: **list, dictionary, set**
* Modular Thinking (splitting features step by step)
