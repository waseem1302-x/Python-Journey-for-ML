# 🧠 Projects

This folder contains beginner-level Python projects built using **control flow concepts** such as `if`, `elif`, `else`, `while` and `for` loops. These projects are part of my Python journey, designed to apply what I’ve learned in real-world scenarios.

## 📁 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Login System
- ✅ Simple username & password system
- 🧠 Concepts: `if-else`, loops, user input
- 🔒 Future upgrades planned: password masking, forgot password, file-based storage

> 📄 File: `01_login_system.py`

---

### 2️⃣ Weekly Health Tracker
- 🚶 Tracks water intake, steps, or other health stats for 7 days
- 📊 Calculates total/average for the week
- 🧠 Concepts: `for` loop, list accumulation, input validation

> 📄 File: `02_weekly_health_tracker.py`

git add .


### 🎓 Gradebook System – Python Control Flow Project

This project demonstrates the use of `if-elif-else`, `functions`, `loops`, and `file handling` to build a simple student gradebook system.

#### 🔧 Features:
- User inputs number of students and their marks
- Calculates grade based on standard scale (A+, A, A-, etc.)
- Handles invalid input gracefully
- Calculates and displays:
  - Average marks
  - Highest & lowest marks
- Exports data to a `student_grades.txt` file

#### 📂 File: `03_student_gradebook.py`

Run it using:
```bash
python 03_student_gradebook.py

🧑‍🏫 Project 4: Student Record System (Mid Level)
Status: Completed
Type: Console-based Python App
Skills Practiced: Control Flow, Data Structures, Problem Solving

A Python program that allows users to register multiple students, input their subject-wise marks, calculate averages, assign grades, and display individual reports.

🧠 Concepts Used:
Control Flow: if, elif, else, loops, break/continue

Data Structures: list, dictionary and set

Modular Thinking: Step-by-step breakdown of features

💡 Features:
Register students with unique IDs

Input subject-wise marks

Automatically calculate average marks and assign grades

Display individual report cards

📌 Reality Check:
This project was built with guided help. I contributed the first few lines myself and worked closely through the logic step-by-step. I’m learning how to think like a problem solver, and this was a solid step in the right direction. The next one will be more independent.
