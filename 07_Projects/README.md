# 🧠 Projects

This folder contains beginner and mid-level Python projects built during my **Python Journey**. Each project was designed to practice specific programming concepts — starting from simple control flow to handling data structures and modular thinking.

These projects represent **milestones in my learning**. They are console-based, intentionally lightweight, but each one helped me practice problem solving and gradually move towards real-world applications.
