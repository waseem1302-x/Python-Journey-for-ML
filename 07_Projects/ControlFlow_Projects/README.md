# 🧠 Python Control Flow Projects

This folder contains beginner-level Python projects built using **control flow concepts** such as `if`, `elif`, `else`, `while` and `for` loops. These projects are part of my Python journey, designed to apply what I’ve learned in real-world scenarios.

## 📁 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Login System
- ✅ Simple username & password system
- 🧠 Concepts: `if-else`, loops, user input
- 🔒 Future upgrades planned: password masking, forgot password, file-based storage

> 📄 File: `01_login_system.py`

### 🎓 Gradebook System – Python Control Flow Project

This project demonstrates the use of `if-elif-else`, `functions`, `loops`, and `file handling` to build a simple student gradebook system.

#### 🔧 Features:
- User inputs number of students and their marks
- Calculates grade based on standard scale (A+, A, A-, etc.)
- Handles invalid input gracefully
- Calculates and displays:
  - Average marks
  - Highest & lowest marks
- Exports data to a `student_grades.txt` file

#### 📂 File: `03_student_gradebook.py`

Run it using:
```bash
python 03_student_gradebook.py
