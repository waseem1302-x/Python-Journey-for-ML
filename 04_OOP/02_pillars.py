INHERITANCE IN PYTHON

Inheritance allows one class (child) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods)
from another class (parent).

Purpose:
‚úÖ Reuse existing code
‚úÖ Avoid repetition (DRY ‚Äì Don't Repeat Yourself)
‚úÖ Build relationships like: is-a

Example:
If we have a 'Car' class,
we can create a 'Cars Brand (Toyotoa, Honda etc)' class that inherits from it,
so Student gets all of Person's features, and can have its own too.

Types:
- Single Inheritance
- Multiple Inheritance

üé≠ Polymorphism means 'many forms'.
In OOP, it allows different classes to have methods with the same name 
but with **different behaviors**.

‚úÖ Purpose:
- To write cleaner, more flexible, and reusable code.
- It lets you call the same method on different objects and get different results.
